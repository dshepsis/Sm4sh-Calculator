### How to use it
Not yet.

#### Launch Visualizer
*Note: Stage layout collision detection might give weird results and bounced trajectories are not accurate, character models/ECBs/animations not included so KO percents are not accurate*

Visualize launch trajectory, position per hitstun frame and distance launched in a graph and display stage layout with collision detection

* Each marker represents each frame in hitstun
* Line color represents vertical momentum
* Cyan markers represents frames that hitstun can be cancelled by using an airdodge
* Magenta markers represents frames that hitstun can be cancelled by using an aerial
* Move angle can be inverted horizontally to visualize hitting opponents from the right side
* Add stage layout with platforms and blast zones with physics (Collision, traction along surfaces, bounce off a surface angle calculation)

Reminder: character models/ECBs/animations not included so KO percents are not accurate by a small margin
